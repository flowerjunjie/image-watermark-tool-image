## Standalone Version Packaging Guide

The Image Watermark Tool provides a standalone version (standalone-app.html) that integrates all functionality without relying on external resources. This is the preferred version for building desktop applications.

### Packaging Steps

1. **Prepare Environment**

   Make sure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build Application**

   Package the application using:
   ```bash
   npm run electron:build
   ```

3. **Fix Resource Paths**

   After packaging, run the fix script to ensure resources load correctly:
   ```bash
   # Full fix (recommended)
   fix-app.bat

   # Or use quick fix
   quick-fix.bat
   ```

4. **Launch Application**

   After packaging and fixing, find the application at:
   ```
   dist_electron\Image Watermark Tool-win32-x64\Image Watermark Tool.exe
   ```

### Troubleshooting Guide

1. **Resource Path Issues**

   - **Problem**: Packaged application may not find resource files, causing blank interface or functionality issues
   - **Solution**: Always run the `fix-app.bat` script after packaging, which automatically copies required resource files

2. **Blank Interface After Packaging**

   - **Problem**: Application starts with a blank interface after packaging
   - **Solution**: 
     - Ensure `standalone-app.html` file is correctly copied to the application directory
     - Check if the main process correctly loads the standalone HTML file
     - Use the `fix-app.bat` script to fix resource paths

3. **Dependency Issues**

   - **Problem**: Some dependencies may be lost or incompatible during packaging
   - **Solution**: Ensure correct dependency versions in `package.json`, manually copy critical dependencies from `node_modules` if necessary

4. **Missing Files**

   - **Problem**: Critical files like `electron/main.js` missing after packaging
   - **Solution**: Run the `fix-app.bat` script, which automatically copies all necessary files

### Recommended Packaging Workflow

To ensure successful packaging and avoid common issues, follow this workflow:

1. Clean old build files:
   ```bash
   rd /s /q dist_electron
   ```

2. Run build command:
   ```bash
   npm run electron:build
   ```

3. Run fix script:
   ```bash
   fix-app.bat
   ```

4. Test if the application runs correctly:
   ```
   dist_electron\Image Watermark Tool-win32-x64\Image Watermark Tool.exe
   ```
