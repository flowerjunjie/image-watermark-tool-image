## Standalone Version Packaging Guide

Image Watermark Tool provides a standalone version (standalone-app.html) that integrates all features without depending on external resources, making it the preferred version for building desktop applications.

### Packaging Steps

1. **Prepare Environment**

   Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build Application**

   Use the following command to package the application:
   ```bash
   npm run electron:build
   ```

3. **Fix Resource Paths**

   After packaging, run the fix script to ensure resources load correctly:
   ```bash
   # Complete fix (recommended)
   fix-app.bat

   # Or use quick fix
   quick-fix.bat
   ```

4. **Launch Application**

   After packaging and fixing, you can find the application at:
   ```
   dist_electron\Image Watermark Tool-win32-x64\Image Watermark Tool.exe
   ```

### Key Features

1. **Multiple Watermark Types**
   - Text Watermark: Custom text, font size, color, and transparency
   - Tiled Watermark: Text covers the entire image in a tiled pattern
   - Image Watermark: Upload custom images as watermarks

2. **Flexible Watermark Settings**
   - Freely drag to adjust watermark position
   - Adjust watermark transparency
   - Set watermark rotation angle
   - Customize watermark color

3. **Batch Processing**
   - Support for uploading and processing multiple images
   - Preserve folder structure
   - Batch export as ZIP archive

4. **Eye Protection Mode**
   - Multiple background color options
   - Reduce eye strain
   - Suitable for extended use

5. **Local Processing**
   - All processing done locally
   - No images uploaded to servers
   - Protects user privacy

### Troubleshooting Guide

1. **Resource Path Issues**

   - **Problem**: After packaging, the application may not find resource files, resulting in blank interfaces or non-functioning features
   - **Solution**: Always run the `fix-app.bat` script after packaging, which automatically copies necessary resource files

2. **Blank Interface After Packaging**

   - **Problem**: After packaging, launching the application shows a blank interface with no content
   - **Solution**: 
     - Ensure the `standalone-app.html` file is correctly copied to the application directory
     - Check if the main process is correctly loading the standalone HTML file
     - Use the `fix-app.bat` script to fix resource paths

3. **Dependency Issues**

   - **Problem**: Some dependencies may be lost or incompatible during packaging
   - **Solution**: Ensure dependency versions in `package.json` are correct, and manually copy critical dependencies from `node_modules` if necessary

4. **Missing Files**

   - **Problem**: Critical files like `electron/main.js` missing after packaging
   - **Solution**: Run the `fix-app.bat` script, which automatically copies all necessary files

### Recommended Packaging Workflow

To ensure successful packaging and avoid common issues, follow this workflow:

1. Clean old build files:
   ```bash
   rd /s /q dist_electron
   ```

2. Execute build command:
   ```bash
   npm run electron:build
   ```

3. Run fix script:
   ```bash
   fix-app.bat
   ```

4. Test if the application runs properly:
   ```
   dist_electron\Image Watermark Tool-win32-x64\Image Watermark Tool.exe
   ```
